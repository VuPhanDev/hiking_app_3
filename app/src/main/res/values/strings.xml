    <string name="the_tatra_m">The Tatra Mountains may not be as famous as the Swiss Alps or the Italian Dolomites, but I personally consider them as one of the best mountain ranges in Europe.\n\nMuch of the Tatra Mountains rises over 2,000m above sea level, offering experienced hikers with a multitude of challenging, diverse trails delivering incredible views - and it wont break the bank getting to, or staying in the region.\n\nThe Tatra Mountains straddle the border between Poland and Slovakia and can be approached from either country with dozens of hiking trails to choose from in the summer months. You could be roaming the trails for a month and still not do it all!</string>
    <string name="text">Grande Aiguille Rousse is a nice pyramidal mountain situated entirely in French territory, however it is in the vicinity of the borderline between France and Italy and for this reason its summit is often reached by Italian besides French alpinists and ski tourers.\u000D\n\u000D\nFrom the top the panorama is great: starting from South direction, the alpinist can see the highest elevations of Maritime, Cotian and Southern Graian Alps, then from East to North is well evident the Gran Paradiso group, northern Graian Alps and Pennine Alps with the Monte Bianco range; from NE to S all the French Graian Alps, the Vanoise Massif and Dauphin\u00C3\u00A9 Massif\u000D\n\u000D\nIt is included into the Vanoise Nat. Park and is close to the borderline of the Gran Paradiso National Park; thanks to that, many animals populate its sides: pack of Ibex and Chamois, eagles, marmots and, with a bit of luck, the bigger European bird, the Bearded Vulture.</string>
